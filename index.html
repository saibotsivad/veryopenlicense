        <h3>Introduction.</h3>
        <p>The Very Open License (or VOL) was made for those who wanted a license as permissive as the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode-plain">CC0</a>, with language as simple as the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL</a>, that would be usable in all countries by businesses and corporations who worry about the legal issues that the WTFPL may not address in some jurisdictions.</p>
        <h3>The License.</h3>
        <p>In its entirety it reads:</p>
