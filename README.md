# Very Open License (or VOL) 1.0

The Very Open License (or VOL) was made for those who wanted a license
as permissive as the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode-plain),
but with language as simple as the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or even the
[WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/), that would be usable by corporations who worry about the
legal status of the WTFPL.

[It's very simple and explicit.](http://veryopenlicense.com)
