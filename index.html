        <h3>Introduction.</h3>
        <p>The Very Open License (or VOL) was made for those who wanted a license
          as permissive as the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode-plain">CC0</a>,
          but with language as simple as the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a> or even the
          <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/about/">WTFPL</a>, that would be usable by corporations who worry about the
          legal status of the WTFPL.</p>
        <h3>The License.</h3>
        <p>In its entirety it reads:</p>
